# Colombian Solar Atlas

## Overview

The **Colombian Solar Atlas** is an interactive tool designed to visualize meteorological data and assess the current and future potential of solar photovoltaic (PV) generation across Colombia, South America. This tool integrates two distinct meteorological databases: historical satellite imagery data and regional-scale climate change projection models. By leveraging both basic and advanced PV generation models, the Colombian Solar Atlas allows users to estimate the solar generation potential of custom installations across the country.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Easily visualize meteorological data across Colombia.
- **Solar Potential Assessment**: Assess the current and future solar PV generation potential at any selected location within the Colombian territory.
- **Dual Meteorological Databases**:
  - **Historical Data**: Extracted from validated satellite imagery information.
  - **Climate Projections**: Data derived from regional-scale climate change models.
- **High Spatial Resolution**: Offers a spatial resolution of 4 kmÂ² for precise analysis.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Select any point on the map to access pertinent information, aiding in the search for optimal solar installation locations.
- **Localized for Colombia**: Tailored to meet the needs of Colombia and presented in the native language.
